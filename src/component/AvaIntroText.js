        <p>
            Just 2 weeks after her 2nd birthday, Ava was diagnosed with Stage 4 High Risk Neuroblastoma - a rare, very
            aggressive childhood cancer with a low survival rate and high change of relapse.
        </p>
        <p>
            A relapse leaves limited treatment options and is almost always terminal.

        <p>
            Avaâ€™s best hope is to receive a new treatment only available from Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York City.
        </p>
        <p>
            We were stunned and horrified to learn that the treatment and associated costs are estimated at
            <b>$300,000</b>, but we are determined to raise the money for our baby girl.
