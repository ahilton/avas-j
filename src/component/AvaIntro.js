                    <p>
                        Just 2 weeks after her 2nd birthday, Ava was diagnosed with Stage 4 High Risk Neuroblastoma - a rare, very aggressive childhood cancer with a low survival rate and high change of relapse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A relapse leaves limited treatment options and is almost always terminal.

                    <p >
                        Avaâ€™s best hope is to receive a new treatment only available from Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York City.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We were stunned and horrified to learn that the treatment and associated costs are estimated at <b>$300,000</b>, but we are determined to raise the money for our baby girl.
