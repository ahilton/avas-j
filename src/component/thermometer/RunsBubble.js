            A special thanks to our aspiring athletes - Paula, Dan, Alex, Kathryn & Clive - for sprinting, jogging and
            hobbling around Australia's half-marathons, trail runs & sprint races to help raise money for Ava's Journey.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Paula Burton</b> & <b>Dan O'Connor</b> deserve a well earned rest after raising more than $5,500 between them. Truly a (half) marathon effort!
