            We have now been together for nearly 6 years, multiple trips across the world, a few different house moves,
            an emigration to Australia, a beautiful daughter Ava and another on the way - a little boy we have already
            named Angus. On a side note - on the plane over to Australia when emigrating, James proposed to me on the
            Emirates flight between Dubai and Australia!
        </p>
        <p>
            James is a social worker, with a background working in child detention in the UK but also works for McKillop
            Family Services here in Australia (he is now actually a full time stay at home dad to Ava since she was
            born, but up until her diagnosis worked casual shifts for McKillop care homes with kids). He is a wonderful
            person with children - especially Ava! They have such a special bond, always fun with dad.

            Leanne works in the pharmaceutical industry - in medical information. I work for an American company
            (global) called Propharma group whom are a consultancy outsourcing firm providing Medical information and
            Pharmacovigilance services to pharmaceutical industry. I am the director of Asia pacific operations. This is
            also why we emigrated to Australia after accepting the role.
        </p>
        <p>
            Leanne continues to work full time during this journey to ensure our family is adequately provided for. This
            isn’t easy, but my job and my role provide flexibility to work remotely from the hospital when needed.

            We moved to Australia in July 2015, and have never looked back! We absolutely love the lifestyle Melbourne,
            and particularly Bayside brings us. It’s a wonderful area to bring up children - We all love our walks to
            the beach, Ava loves Black Rock park, it’s great to have wonderful coffee shops and food on our doorsteps in
            Bayside but still keeping that small quiet town feel.

            It feels very homely, very welcoming and we feel very settled into the community and life here.
