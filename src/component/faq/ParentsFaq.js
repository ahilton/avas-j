            What are the parents’ backgrounds? How are they managing work so that they can pay the bills with
            Ava being so unwell?

            We have now been together for nearly 6 years, multiple trips across the world, a few different house
            moves, an emigration to Australia, a beautiful daughter Ava and another on the way - a little boy we
            have already named Angus. On a side note - on the plan over to Australia when emigrating, james
            proposed to me on the Emirates flight between Dubai and Australia!

            James is a social worker with a background working in child detention in the UK but also works for
            McKillop Family Services here in Australia (he is now actually an full time stay at home dad to Ava
            since she was born, but up until her diagnosis worked casual shifts for McKillop care homes with kids).
            He is a wonderful person with children - especially Ava! They have such a special bond, always fun with
            dad.

            Leanne works in the pharmaceutical industry - in medical information. I work for a American company
            (global) called propharma group whom are a consultancy outsourcing firm providing Medical information
            and Pharmacovigilance services to pharmaceutical industry. I am the director of Asia pacific operations.
            This is also why we emigrated to Australia after accepting the role.

            We moved to Australia back in July 2015 and have never looked back! We absolutely love the lifestyle
            Melbourne and particularly bayside brings us. It’s a wonderful area to bring up children - We all love
            our walks to the beach, Ava loves black rock park, it’s great to have wonderful coffee shops and food on
            our doorsteps in bayside but still keeping that small quiet town feel. It feels very homely, very
            welcoming and we feel very settled into the community and life here.
        </p>

            We first lived temporary in Brighton north before the birth of Ava, then moved to mentone. We have
            recently just moved to Black Rock as a bigger house was needed for our expanding family.
