            Why does the family have to go to NYC for the vaccination and why does it cost so much?
        </h2>
        <p>
            When we get Ava into remission of this cancer the battle is far from over. Neuroblastoma is a
            difficult disease to treat and in over 75% of patients, they relapse. A relapse of Neuroblastoma
            currently brings a very low prognosis of survival - current available treatment across the world is
            not successful and most cases result in fatality. A 1 in 2 relapse rate.
        </p>

            There is hope for Ava and other kids like her however at Memorial Sloan Kettering hospital in New York.
            A trial with extraordinary results in keeping kids clear for years longer than ever seen before.

            The hard part - The cost to have this medication known as a Neuroblastoma vaccine as an international
            patient is US$160,000 â€“ around AU$225,000. Which is not funded by pharmaceutical companies, government
            or hospitals. The funding must come directly from the patient / Carers. This cost is actually reduced
            from a much higher figure - this is a negotiated down price with the help of a very lovely family who
            runs a charity in the UK - the Bradley Lowry foundation.

            The neuroblastoma world specialists are at Memorial Sloan Kettering, a hospital in New York which sees
            over 125 new cases of this rare cancer a year. They have 5 Neuroblastoma experts on site and the man
            recognised as the best neuroblastoma surgeon in the world.

            MSK has completed and published a phase 1 trial with children who have already relapsed with
            Neuroblastoma once and been cleared a second time (these are considered extremely tough cases). These
            kids would be expected to relapse again within a very short timeframe (months). The study (link below)
            shows these kids remaining relapse-free almost 3 years later.
        </p>
        <p>
            With this kind of data - you can see why any parent would want to give their child this chance of
            survival! What price can you place on giving a child the chance to live past the age of 5. I will do
            anything.
