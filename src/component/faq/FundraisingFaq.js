            Asking for help and money doesnâ€™t come natural to us. We have always worked hard, proud for what we have
            achieved and what we make for ourselves and our family, but this would not be possible to achieve alone.
            It takes a community to come together to help offer Ava a chance in life. Please please help us give Ava
            the best shot of living a life like we have been graced with. We could not be more grateful and indebted
            to all those who have supported us so far and continue to support - this community is truly amazing!
