            The vaccination and associated costs are estimated at a daunting $350,000. We have been blessed to have been
            supported by family, friends, companies and strangers and so far have raised $98,400. There is still a long
            road ahead and there are a range of <a href='/events'>events</a> and activities coming up.
        </p>
        <p>
            Asking for help and money doesnâ€™t come natural to us. We have always worked hard, proud for what we have
            achieved and what we make for ourselves and our family, but this would not be possible to achieve alone. It
            takes a community to come together to help offer Ava a chance in life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please, please help us give Ava the best shot of living a life like we have been graced with. We could not
            be more grateful and indebted to all those who have supported us so far and continue to support - this
            community is truly amazing!
