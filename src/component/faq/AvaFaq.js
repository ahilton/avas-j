            There’s so much we can say about this wonderful little girl. She’s only been on this earth for 2 years, and
            4 months but she has changed our lives and many others in so many positive ways. Ava is just wonderful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ava was born in Sandringham hospital on 24th March, 2016. She was a big chubby healthy baby.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ava grew like any normal little girl - she loved attending swimming classes, Gymbaroo, dancing and Baby
            Sensory. James and I took Ava to so many to activities within the community, she loves socialising and
            engaging with others. Ava has never attended childcare as James is a stay at home father, but she did attend
            the Fitness First gym crèche which she loved - and the staff at Brighton & Bayside Fitness First are
            wonderful with Ava.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ava is a very bright 2 year old - she loves to sing and dance. She sings the whole alphabet, and likes to
            spin around in her ‘dancing shoes’ which are her pretty pink ‘Clark’s’. She loves animals very much so we
            used to visit the farm, zoos and the aquarium a lot. Ava’s favourite land animal is a Hippo, and favourite
            sea animal is a Sting Ray.

        <p>
            Whenever you see Ava she will also have 2 pink jelly-cat bunnies with her; these are her comforters and her
            most special toys!
        </p>
        <p>
            Ava unfortunately doesn’t get to attend any of her classes anymore, due to treatment and her health but on
            the odd times we are out of hospital we love to take her to the beach - she adores playing in the sand and
            collecting shells. She loves walks amongst trees and waterfalls (she loves being outdoors), and chatting to
            people as much as possible. She truly is the most confident little 2 year old I think anyone has ever met.
            She will sit and chat with everyone and persuade them to play.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite this overwhelming account of her journey so far; including 7 cycles of chemotherapy; Ava is still a
            happy little girl. The treatment is, and will continue to have an effect on her physical and mental health,
            but we manage that as best we can with great support from the Royal Children’s Hospital - they’re truly
            amazing.
        </p>
        <p>
            We manage it with lots of friends who visit, lots of engaging and fun activities in and out of hospital, and
            as much positivity as we can all muster.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ava is unbelievably strong - she lives in the moment. Some moments are hard and upsetting, but then others
            are happy, funny and bright! She never fails to smile, to laugh and to bring joy to others. She’s truly a
            gift!
