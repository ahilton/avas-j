            There’s so much we can say about this wonderful little girl. She’s only been on this earth for 2
            years and 4 months but she has changed our lives and many others in so many positive ways. She’s
            just wonderful.

            Ava was born in sandy hospital on 24th March 2016. She was a big chubby healthy baby.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ava grew like any normal little girl - she loved attending swimming classes, gymbaroo, dancing and
            baby
            sensory. James and I took her to so much to engage her in activities and socialise in the community.
            Ava
            never attended childcare as James is a stay at home father but she did attend the Fitness First gym
            crèche which she loved - and the staff at Brighton Fitness First are wonderful with Ava.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ava is a very bright 2 year old - she loves to sing and dance. She sings the whole alphabet and
            likes to
            spin around in “her dancing shoes” which are her pretty pink Clark’s. She loves animals very much so
            we
            used to visit the farm, zoos and the aquarium a lot. We are members of them. Ava’s favourite animal
            is a
            hippo and favourite sea animal is a sting ray.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever you see Ava she will also have 2 pink jelly Cat bunnies with her- these are her comforters
            and
            her most special toys!
        </p>
        <p>
            Ava unfortunately doesn’t get to attend any of her classes anymore due to treatment and her health
            but
            on the odd times we are out of hospital we love to take her to the beach - which she adores, walks
            amongst trees and waterfalls (she loves being outdoors) and as much as possible chatting to people -
            she
            truly is the most confident little 2 year old I think anyone has ever met. She will sit and chat
            with
            everyone and persuade you to play. :)
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite this overwhelming account of her journey so far; 6 cycles of chemotherapy in and Ava is
            still a
            happy little girl. Sure, this is and will continue to have an affect on her physical and mental
            Health
            but we manage that with great support from RCH - they’re truly amazing. We manage it with lots of
            friends who visit, lots of engaging and fun activities in hospital and out, and as much positivity
            as we
            can all muster.
        </p>
        <p>
            She is unbelievably strong - she lives in the moment. Some moments are hard and upsetting, but then
            others are happy, funny and bright! She never fails to smile, to laugh and to bring joy to others.
            She’s
            truly a gift!
