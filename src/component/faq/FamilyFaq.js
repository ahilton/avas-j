            I can’t even imagine what this would be like. How is the family doing?
        </h2>
        <p>
            We spend approx 2.5-3 weeks of every month in hospital at the moment. That’s 2.5-3 weeks where Ava
            is bound to one hospital ward. She cannot go outside, cannot leave the ward and is attached to
            multiple lines and machines.

            Something about their family growing with a baby brother for Ava?
