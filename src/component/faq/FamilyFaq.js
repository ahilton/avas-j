            We spend approximately 2-3 weeks of every month in hospital at the moment. Thatâ€™s 2-3 weeks where Ava is bound to one hospital ward. She cannot go outside, cannot leave the ward and is attached to multiple lines and machines.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our family is also growing. Ava's brother, Angus, was born Monday 17th of September.
