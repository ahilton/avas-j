            Our little fighter Ava is in her 6th round of chemo now. Ava has a long road ahead - at least 18
            months of treatment which will involve chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, stem cell transplant and
            immunotherapy - a gruelling road for anyone, least a toddler.

            When we get Ava into remission of this cancer the battle is far from over. Neuroblastoma is a difficult
            disease to treat and in over 75% of patients, they relapse. A relapse of Neuroblastoma currently brings
            a very low prognosis of survival - current available treatment across the world is not successful and
            most cases result in fatality. A 1 in 2 relapse rate.

            There is hope for Ava and other kids like her however at Memorial Sloan Kettering hospital in New York.
            A trial with extraordinary results in keeping kids clear for years longer than ever seen before.

            Our aim is get there by XXX.
