                <h2 className='normal'>What is little Ava like?</h2>
                <p>
                    There’s so much we can say about this wonderful little girl. She’s only been on this earth for 2
                    years and 4 months but she has changed our lives and many others in so many positive ways. She’s
                    just wonderful.
                </p><p>
                Ava was born in sandy hospital on 24th March 2016. She was a big chubby healthy baby.
            </p><p>
                Ava grew like any normal little girl - she loved attending swimming classes, gymbaroo, dancing and baby
                sensory. James and I took her to so much to engage her in activities and socialise in the community. Ava
                never attended childcare as James is a stay at home father but she did attend the Fitness First gym
                crèche which she loved - and the staff at Brighton Fitness First are wonderful with Ava.
            </p><p>
                Ava is a very bright 2 year old - she loves to sing and dance. She sings the whole alphabet and likes to
                spin around in “her dancing shoes” which are her pretty pink Clark’s. She loves animals very much so we
                used to visit the farm, zoos and the aquarium a lot. We are members of them. Ava’s favourite animal is a
                hippo and favourite sea animal is a sting ray.
            </p><p>
                Whenever you see Ava she will also have 2 pink jelly Cat bunnies with her- these are her comforters and
                her most special toys!
            </p><p>
                Ava unfortunately doesn’t get to attend any of her classes anymore due to treatment and her health but
                on the odd times we are out of hospital we love to take her to the beach - which she adores, walks
                amongst trees and waterfalls (she loves being outdoors) and as much as possible chatting to people - she
                truly is the most confident little 2 year old I think anyone has ever met. She will sit and chat with
                everyone and persuade you to play. :)
            </p><p>
                Despite this overwhelming account of her journey so far; 6 cycles of chemotherapy in and Ava is still a
                happy little girl. Sure, this is and will continue to have an affect on her physical and mental Health
                but we manage that with great support from RCH - they’re truly amazing. We manage it with lots of
                friends who visit, lots of engaging and fun activities in hospital and out, and as much positivity as we
                can all muster.
            </p><p>
                She is unbelievably strong - she lives in the moment. Some moments are hard and upsetting, but then
                others are happy, funny and bright! She never fails to smile, to laugh and to bring joy to others. She’s
                truly a gift!
            </p>
                <h2 className='normal'>
                    How did Ava’s diagnosis come about?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A couple of days after Ava’s second birthday we noticed she wasn’t herself. She became very upset,
                    she stopped sleeping well and would wake a lot crying. She stopped eating well, was having fevers
                    frequently and eventually stopped walking, playing and was inconsolable.
                </p><p>
                During all of this we took her to the doctors and (through no fault of the GPs) were told it was
                viruses, then. uTI infection and given antibiotics.
            </p><p>
                11 days after this started we decided this was too much and after seeing Ava not walking that day, just
                laying on the sofa too lethargic to play we took her to the royal children’s hospital emergency. This is
                where the journey started
            </p><p>
                Ava that every same day had ultrasounds, X-rays (looking for septic arthritis initially) and then the
                following evening had an MRI scan
            </p><p>
                On the morning of 7th April 2018, 6 doctors walked into our little room and I instinctively knew it was
                cancer. I don’t quite remember their whole talk, but I do remember one of the junior doctors tears in
                his eyes as he tried to speak. They explained that the MRI hadn’t shown any sign of fluid in the joints,
                but had shown some masses across Ava’s body. Masses consistent with tumours.
            </p><p>
                A senior consultant oncologist (who remains in charge of Ava’s care today) went on to explain - he
                believes it’s Neuroblastoma. He explained further that Ava’s disease on the MRI shows its present in her
                bones - pelvis, femurs, spine, skull, eye sockets and small spots in other bones. She has a large
                primary mass in her adrenal gland above the left kidney, smaller spots in the lung and along spine.
                Ava’s disease is in her bone marrow, her lymph and blood. This is known as Stage 4 high risk
                Neuroblastoma. A rare and very aggressive childhood cancer affecting approximately 40-60 patients a year
                in Australia.
            </p><p>
                Our lives were crushed. I couldn’t comprehend - our little 2 year old who only up until 11 days ago was
                so happy, bubbly, healthy has stage 4 cancer. Who without starting aggressive treatment immediately
                would die within months. I still can’t comprehend it sometimes. It still hits me hard when I’m least
                expecting it.
            </p><p>
                So there we were - in hospital, a whirlwind of information being passed our way about how the next 18
                months and beyond we’re going to look. An aggressive treatment protocol for this kind of cancer. Ava
                would receive 5 cycles of rapid chemotherapy, surgery, transplant chemotherapy (designed to wipe out
                bone marrow), a stem cell transplant, radiotherapy and then immunotherapy treatment. All this on a tiny
                body, still a baby to me.
            </p>
                <h2 className='normal'>
                    What has Ava had to go through so far?

                        <li>
                            She’s undergone several scans - MRIs, CTs, Ultrasounds, MRIs, heart scans such as

                        <li>
                            Countless blood tests, urine tests, stool samples etc all checking her levels.

                        <li>
                            Received approx 10 blood and platelet transfusions

                <p>
                    On 11th July 2018 we received more awful news. Scans done after 4 cycles of chemo have shown little
                    reduction in Ava’s disease. At that stage they would expect her score count (which at diagnosis was
                    18) to be less than 3. Ava’s was still 15. Again more devastating news.
                </p>

                <h2 className='normal'>
                    What’s next for Ava? (last updated at XX/XX/XXXX)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our little fighter Ava is in her 6th round of chemo now. Ava has a long road ahead - at least 18
                    months of treatment which will involve chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, stem cell transplant and
                    immunotherapy - a gruelling road for anyone, least a toddler.
                </p><p>

                When we get Ava into remission of this cancer the battle is far from over. Neuroblastoma is a difficult
                disease to treat and in over 75% of patients, they relapse. A relapse of Neuroblastoma currently brings
                a very low prognosis of survival - current available treatment across the world is not successful and
                most cases result in fatality. A 1 in 2 relapse rate.
            </p><p>
                There is hope for Ava and other kids like her however at Memorial Sloan Kettering hospital in New York.
                A trial with extraordinary results in keeping kids clear for years longer than ever seen before.

                The hard part - The cost to have this medication known as a Neuroblastoma vaccine as an international
                patient is US$160,000 – around AU$225,000. Which is not funded by pharmaceutical companies, government
                or hospitals. The funding must come directly from the patient / Carers. This cost is actually reduced
                from a much higher figure - this is a negotiated down price with the help of a very lovely family who
                runs a charity in the UK - the Bradley Lowry foundation.
            </p><p>
                The neuroblastoma world specialists are at Memorial Sloan Kettering, a hospital in New York which sees
                over 125 new cases of this rare cancer a year. They have 5 Neuroblastoma experts on site and the man
                recognised as the best neuroblastoma surgeon in the world.
            </p><p>
                MSK has completed and published a phase 1 trial with children who have already relapsed with
                Neuroblastoma once and been cleared a second time (these are considered extremely tough cases). These
                kids would be expected to relapse again within a very short timeframe (months). The study (link below)
                shows these kids remaining relapse-free almost 3 years later.
            </p><p>
                With this kind of data - you can see why any parent would want to give their child this chance of
                survival! What price can you place on giving a child the chance to live past the age of 5. I will do
                anything.

                <p>
                    We spend approx 2.5-3 weeks of every month in hospital at the moment. That’s 2.5-3 weeks where Ava
                    is bound to one hospital ward. She cannot go outside, cannot leave the ward and is attached to
                    multiple lines and machines.

                    We have now been together for nearly 6 years, multiple trips across the world, a few different house
                    moves, an emigration to Australia, a beautiful daughter Ava and another on the way - a little boy we
                    have already named Angus. On a side note - on the plan over to Australia when emigrating, james
                    proposed to me on the Emirates flight between Dubai and Australia!

                James is a social worker with a background working in child detention in the UK but also works for
                McKillop Family Services here in Australia (he is now actually an full time stay at home dad to Ava
                since she was born, but up until her diagnosis worked casual shifts for McKillop care homes with kids).
                He is a wonderful person with children - especially Ava! They have such a special bond, always fun with
                dad.

                Leanne works in the pharmaceutical industry - in medical information. I work for a American company
                (global) called propharma group whom are a consultancy outsourcing firm providing Medical information
                and Pharmacovigilance services to pharmaceutical industry. I am the director of Asia pacific operations.
                This is also why we emigrated to Australia after accepting the role.
            </p><p>

                We moved to Australia back in July 2015 and have never looked back! We absolutely love the lifestyle
                Melbourne and particularly bayside brings us. It’s a wonderful area to bring up children - We all love
                our walks to the beach, Ava loves black rock park, it’s great to have wonderful coffee shops and food on
                our doorsteps in bayside but still keeping that small quiet town feel. It feels very homely, very
                welcoming and we feel very settled into the community and life here.
            </p><p>
                We first lived temporary in Brighton north before the birth of Ava, then moved to mentone. We have
                recently just moved to Black Rock as a bigger house was needed for our expanding family.
